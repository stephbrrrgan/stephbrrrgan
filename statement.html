For my <a href="stephbrrrgan.github.io"> data visualization</a>, I knew I wanted to do something with maps and my whereabouts. At first, I had thought about creating a visualization of all the places I have been in the U.S. and for how long, but given the size of the map, it would have been too complicated to navigate. Instead, I created this map of Oakland to show what I do, where I go, and for how long   over the course of two weeks. It’s interesting to see what some average college students do with their time, and this is just a glimpse of mine. <br>
<br>
My life is pretty mundane, and I do the same things each week with a few exceptions, so I really wanted to look at the time I spend at the places I go to on campus. Using OpenStreetMap, I was able to pick a general area to focus on for my map: Oakland.  To emphasize the amount of time spent at each location, I varied the size of the icons used: the larger the icon, the longer period of time spent at that specific place. I didn’t take into account the amount of walking around and having outside be a specific location because that would have gotten a little crazy. I would have liked to create paths for each day, but it would have made the map overwhelming and more difficult to read. For my first time using Leaflet, and actually JavaScript, I wanted to do something more simple in order to gain a better understanding of the program and script. I can use this simple map to branch off into something more complex for the next assignment. Hopefully, for my next one I can figure out how to do the whole country and my travelling because for this assignment, I wasn’t able to create a map so large. Instead of using a map, I want to be able to create a different type of visualization that still emphasizes travel. <br>
<br>
While working on this project, I only hit a few roadblocks. Of course, the first problem was the map of the size. I thought if I had just picked the center of the U.S. and set the zoom on a lower number, it’d work, but I’m glad that I chose to pick a smaller area for my first attempt at Leaflet. I was able to follow multiple tutorials and read a lot of helpful tips to help with GeoJSON, but when I would add my file into the coding, for some reason my icons that I had selected wouldn’t show up. I unfortunately had to do it a different way even though I understood the coding. I knew for this process I had to convert my CSV file into a GeoJSON one, but somewhere along the line, I did something wrong. I'm hoping to work at discovering this issue, and doing it correctly next time. Lastly, I had problems with transferring over my files from my personal network onto Github. I think my issue is not being as organized as I should have, so next time, I will have to be more on top of everything in order to not make the mistake of missing a file or changing a local server coding to a public one. <br>
<br>
Overall, I was able to showcase my whereabouts during two weeks here in Oakland, Although my life is quite boring, it’s still interesting to see the hours spent at each location, and hopefully next time I can expand more on this.
